Data
++++

The tcrdist2 standard input is a pandas.DataFrame

The header and first line of a typical input for beta-chain analysis would look like this:

+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| subject    | epitope    | count      | v_b_gene   | j_b_gene   | cdr3_b_aa            | cdr3_b_nucseq                                             |
+============+============+============+============+============+======================+===========================================================+
| s1         |   NP       |   1        | TRBV1*01   | TRBJ1-1*01 | CACDSLGDKSSWDTRQMFF  | TGTGCCTGTGACTCGCTGGGGGATAAGAGCTCCTGGGACACCCGACAGATGTTTTTC |
+------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+			


Column names reflect the chain under investigation. 
- a : alpha
- b : beta
- g : gamma
- d : delta

One or more of the following columns are required and are case-sensitive  
    - 'v_a_gene', 'v_b_gene', 'v_g_gene', or 'v_d_gene' 
    - 'j_a_gene', 'j_b_gene', 'j_g_gene', or 'j_d_gene' 
    - 'cdr3_a_aa', 'cdr3_b_aa', 'cdr3_g_aa', or  'cdr3a_d_aa'
    - 'cdr3_a_nucseq', 'cdr3_b_nucseq, 'cdr3_g_nucseq', or 'cdr3a_d_nucseq' 

.. tip::

    Two of each can be supplied for paired analysis. tcrdistances can be calculated 
    without nucleotide sequences, but most other features require them.


The following is required.
    - 'count'

The following are optional:
    - 'epitope`
    - 'subject'


The following are usually inferred from germline reference v-gene but can be supplied by the user in some advanced use-cases only!
    -  'cdr1_a_aa', 'cdr1_b_aa',  'cdr1_g_aa',  or 'cdr1_d_aa'
    -  'cdr2_a_aa', 'cdr2_b_aa',  'cdr2_g_aa',  or 'cdr2_d_aa'
    -  'pmhc_a_aa', 'pmhc_a_aa',  'pmhc_a_aa',  or 'pmhc_a_aa' (pmhc = cdr 2.5)

.. tip::

  CDR2.5, the pMHC-facing loop between CDR2 and CDR3, are referred to in tcrdist2 as pmhc_a and phmc_b, respectively.



Arguments
+++++++++

chain(s)
-------

Most classes and functions in tcrdist2 require specification of the appropriate t cell receptor 
chains:
    - ['alpha'], ['beta'], ['gamma'], or ['delta'] for single-chain analysis, 
    - ['alpha', 'beta'] or ['gamma', 'delta'] for paired-chain analyis 

organism
--------

Most classes and functions in tcrdist2 require specification of an appropriate host organism. 
Currently only 'human' or 'mouse' are supported. This is required because reference TCR genes
are organism specific. 

db_file
-------

The `db_file` is used by tcrdist2 to supply updated information about reference TCR germline sequences. 

These files come with tcrdist2:

`tcrdist2/tcrdist/db/alphabeta_db.tsv`
`tcrdist2/tcrdist/db/gammadelta_db.tsv`
